Q1. A professor went to a party. Being an erudite person, he classified the party into two categories. He proposed that if all the persons in the party are wearing different colored
robes, then that is a girl’s only party. If we even get one duplicate color, it must be a boy’s party. The colors of the robes are represented by positive integers.

 

Example 1:

Input
N = 5
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
Output
GIRLS
Explanation:
All the colors are unique so it's a GIRLS party.
 

Example 2:

Input
N = 6
A[] = {1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1}
Output
BOYS
Explanation:
There are two colors 1. So it's a BOYS party.

Q2. Find the Missing Number

You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in the list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.
Example: 

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8}
Output: 5
Explanation: The missing number from 1 to 8 is 5

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 5}
Output: 4
Explanation: The missing number from 1 to 5 is 4


Q3. Write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader. For example int the array {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, leaders are 17, 5 and 2. 
Let the input array be arr[] and size of the array be size.


Q4. Given two strings a and b consisting of lowercase characters. The task is to check whether two given strings are an anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “act” and “tac” are an anagram of each other.

e.g listen silent
